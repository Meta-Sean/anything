file to take notes on lesson 3 and turn into blog/review

first we took a look at Ross Wightman's library PyTorch Image Model's to analyze the speed and memory trade-offs of different image models to gauge performance
a nice heuristic Jeremy recommended is to start small and get building / iterating 
These interactive ploty charts are a super cool way to display and play with your data

then into the real meat and potatoes, under the hood, I'll be honest I've spent and continue to spend lots of time gets reps of this information and vocabulary, it seems very important to me and if anything want this info to stick. 
lets talk about the flow then try to break it down piece by piece:


question, what if our loss function is messy to traverse? how do we know that our step sizes are too small or too big? I imagine a mountainous region with many peaks and troughs, how do know we have reached the bottom or are just at a local minima for a subspace of the loss?
