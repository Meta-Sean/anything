# Zeroth Lecture

## Meta-Learning and Set-up

This lecture was super insightful and contained some awesome tricks and tools to suceed in the practical deep learning course.

The biggest take away and process I will attempt to follow is this how to:
- watch Lecture
- run notebook & experiment
- reproduce results
- repeat with different dataset

In addition to reviewing and reflecting on the information in flashcard (aiquizzes.com), and writting this blog!

Really look forward to taking MIT's missing semester course covering:
- code concepts
- editor
- git & gh
- ssh / Linux

Speaking of linux and ssh, towards the end of the lesson we got a look at spinning up a AWS server to get some juicy GPU's to help us build our models in the future. I've fooled around with a rasberry-pi in the past but besides that have little experience with rsa, ssh, and managing remote systems.
Feel like a big hackerman
